# WHY I LOVE TO CODE

This repo is our initial repository, to contain personal reasons why each one the team members decided to join the team and write code everyday!

## The format should be:

`Name`: ex: Luc Shawn
`Personal Github Url`: ex: github.com/odeloic

`BIO`: Just 3 lines to describe what you hope to achieve in joining a team to code.

`SKILLS`: What you already know
`WHY`: Then you should start list down reasons why you are willing to commit a portion of your valuable time to this quest.

ex: # WHYs
1. reason
2. reason
3. more reasons...

Thank you, cheers!
